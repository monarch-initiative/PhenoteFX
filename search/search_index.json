Therefore, the first thing to do is to  grab the pubmed id from the article you are curating.</p> <p>For this example, we will use data from  Klopocki E, et al. (2008_) A microduplication of the long range SHH limb regulator (ZRS)  is associated with triphalangeal thumb-polysyndactyly syndrome. J Med Genet. 45:370-5.</p> <p>The corresponding ID that PhenoteFX expects is  PMID:18178630 (no space in between PMID: and the number, but PhenoteFX will  automatically remove spaces when you paste the id into the dialog).</p> <p></p> PhenoteFX - specifying the PubMed id  <p>Paste the PMID into the <code>source</code> field, as shown above.</p> <p>Now we can add the first annotation. In this case, we will add the mode of inheritance as  Autosomal dominant inheritance HP:0000006.

Then click on the <code>Add annotation</code> button. </p> <p></p> PhenoteFX - Autosomal dominant <p>This adds the annotation to the curation file. The PMID is now stored as the default value and does not need to be changed unless you want to switch to a new citation.</p> <p></p> PhenoteFX - Features <p>We can see the clinical features to annotate in Table 1 of  PMID:18178630. For instance, 11 of 12 affected  individuals had  Triphalangeal thumb HP:0001199. We can enter the frequency data as follows (and click the <code>Add annotation</code> button to enter the annotation). Note that in this case, the context of the article implies that if a <code>+</code> is not shown inthe table, the individual  did not have the feature in question. This may not always be the case and the curator should read the article to be  able to accurately curate the data.</p> <p></p> PhenoteFX - Annotating triphalangeal thumb <p>We continue entering features in this way. The table states that five individuals had <code>syndactly</code>. However, the text  states that individuals in the family had <code>cutaneous/osseous syndactyly of fingers III\u2013V or IV/V</code>. We do not have further details, and we typically curate with as much detail as possible given the data in the original publication. To search for a more detailed syndactyly term, we can use the HPO ontology browser on the top right of PhenoteFX.</p> <p></p> PhenoteFX - Ontology Browser <p>From this, we choose the term  Finger syndactyly HP:0006101.</p> <p></p> PhenoteFX - annotations <p>The above figure shows the appearance of PhenoteFX after we have entered several annotations.
