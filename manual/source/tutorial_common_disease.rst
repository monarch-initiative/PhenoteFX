Common Disease Annotation with PhenoteFX
========================================

PhenoteFX now supports common disease annotation for the model defined in this repository: `commonDiseaseAnnotation`_.

.. _commonDiseaseAnnotation: https://github.com/monarch-initiative/commonDiseaseAnnotation

Briefly, this model considers the following aspects of a common disease:

- Prevalence
- Incidence
- Onset
- Phenotype
- Risk Factor

For each category, PhenoteFX allows biocurators to add multiple pieces of information from literature.


To compile PhenoteFX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The `commonDiseaseAnnotation`_ repo is not yet public. So you need to request access and install it on you local computer if you want to compile PhenoteFX. The other option is to use the pre-compiled version of PhenoteFX.
