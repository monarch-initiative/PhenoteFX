Setting up PhenoteFX
====================

When you use PhenoteFX for the first time, you need to download some files and tell PhenoteFX
where you would like to store the annotation files.

1. **Download Medgen HPO OMIM**
This is a file frlom Medgen that contains the names of OMIM
entries; we use this file to translate between an item such as OMIM:100001 and Smith Syndrome. This
file will be replaced by a MONDO file soon.

2. **Download HPO**
This will download the latest release of hp.obo from the HPO GitHub page.

3. **Set biocurator id**
Enter whatever you would like be be nano-attributed by, e.g., MGM:rrabbit.

4. **Set default directory for phenoteFX files**
Usually this will be the directory to which you have downloaded the GitHub repository for the HPO annotations.
Please choose the subdirectory ``hpo-annotation-data/rare-diseases/annotated``.

5. **Show settings**
This item opens a window to show the current settings.


The remaining menu items in the setup menu are experimental and not needed for rare disease annotation.
