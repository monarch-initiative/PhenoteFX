# PhenoteFX
PhenoteFX is a Java app that is designed to help create and maintain Human Phenotype Ontology annotation files.

## Requirements
PhenoteFX requires Java 16 or better.

## Installation
We are in the process of refactoring. We need to locally install [fenominal](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/fenominal)
with maven to build PhenoteFX.

## Using PhenoteFX
Please consult the [documentation](http://phenotefx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for 
a tutorial on how to install and use PhenoteFX.

The latest version can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/PhenoteFX/releases) page.
