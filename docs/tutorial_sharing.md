# Sharing curation files 


The files that are created and saved in this way will be saved in the default PhenoteFX directory - 
see [setup](tutorial_setup.md). They are tab-separated text files that can be opened in Microsoft Excel if desired. 
Share these files with the HPO team to submit new disease annotations for including the HPO resource.
